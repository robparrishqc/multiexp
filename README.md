# MultiExp Quadratures

This repository contains the numerical data obtained in our recent campaign to
produce Gill and Chien's MultiExp Gaussian quadratures for N <= 100.

# Data

`data/multiexp-N100-Q2E8.npz` - the preferred MultiExp quadrature rules for 1
<= N <= 100 obtained with our most-accurate Q=2x10^8 treatment.
